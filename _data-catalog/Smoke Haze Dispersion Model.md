<h4><strong>ASMC SMOKE HAZE DISPERSION MODEL</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The animation shows the estimated surface PM10 concentration over a 24-hour period from 00 to 24 UTC at 3-hourly intervals. A 24-hour look-ahead is provided for haze affecting the ASEAN region, based on numerical modelling. The predictive simulation is generally updated by 00 UTC each day; however the upload time will vary slightly depending on the number of fires detected and available input information.</strong>
